# Frontend System Design

Talk about `design tradeoffs`, possible implementations, not necessarily coding it out. Because system design questions usually involve multiple components and knowledge across the web stack, candidates usually do not have to go very deep into the lower-level details of each component and keep the discussion at a `higher level`, about `API design` between `client and server`, and API `between components`.

Topics from [Building User Interfaces](./building-user-interfaces.md) are also relevant here.

There are two types: 1. Component and 2. Application.

## Examples

- Components
  - Autocomplete
  - Image carousel
  - Dropdown menu
  - Modal dialog
- Applications
  - News feed
  - E-commerce application
  - Photo sharing
  - Video watching
